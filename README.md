# Python-learning
Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, ScikitLearn and ML

In this repo I will upload some basic example of what I learn through courses and lectures.
I won't upload the data files used as this is just for demonstrative purposes and to keep track of what I learn.

Some of the files will be commented to help me understand why some choices are made should I use again the same procedure in the future.

No copyright violation is intended, everything that is posted here could be find online and is just a record of my learning path.
